Now we need to create a policy, to do this go to Devices – Macos – Configuration – create – new policy – settings catalog – name your policy – Add settings – Full Disk Encryption – FileVault. You can take the settings from the screenshot. You can of course play around with the rotation.

That is it, now your device will be encrypted during the setup.
