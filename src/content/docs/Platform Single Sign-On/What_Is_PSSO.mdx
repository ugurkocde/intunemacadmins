  The PSSO feature was something that we have waited a long time for. Having a
  way for the user to use the same EntraID Password for their sign-in to the Mac
  is a huge win. Otherwise the user would have to live with two different
  passwords. With the latest PSSO release, multiple authentication methods are
  supported, including Secure Enclave, Password Authentication, and Smart Card.

Platform Single Sign-On (SSO) for macOS with Microsoft Intune allows users to sign into their Mac devices using their Microsoft Entra ID credentials. This integration simplifies the sign-in process, enhances security, and reduces the number of passwords users need to remember.
Key Features and Benefits:

### Authentication Methods

- **Secure Enclave**: Utilizes Apple's Secure Enclave for hardware-bound cryptographic keys, enabling passwordless authentication through Touch ID.
  - This method does not support password sync but is recommended for its security in storing tokens and being phishing resistant. You can find more about the recommendation here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/platform-sso-macos#step-1---decide-the-authentication-method
- **Password Authentication**: Syncs Microsoft Entra ID password with the local macOS account password.
- **Smart Card**: Uses an external smart card for authentication.

<Aside type="caution">
  Secure Enclave is recommended for its security in storing tokens, it does not
  support password sync. If password sync is needed, you should use the Password
  Authentication method.

### Security

- Integrates with Apple's Secure Enclave for phishing-resistant, hardware-bound authentication.
- Supports Zero Trust security models by eliminating passwords as primary attack vectors.

### User Experience

- Users can log into their Mac devices and automatically gain access to business applications and websites that support SSO without re-entering credentials.
- The synchronization of local and Entra ID passwords ensures a consistent login experience.
