**Step 2: Verify Device Type Restrictions**

The error may be caused by device type restrictions that block macOS devices from enrolling. 
To check and modify these settings:

1. In the Intune portal, go to Devices > Enrollment.
2. Click on Apple.
3. Select Device platform restrictions and switch to the macOS restrictions tab.

**Step 3: Adjust Restrictions**

1. Review the existing device restrictions to ensure that macOS devices are allowed to enroll.
2. If multiple restrictions exist, examine each one to confirm that the macOS platform is permitted.
3. To modify a restriction, go to its Properties and check the Platform settings.
4. Ensure that macOS devices are not blocked and are allowed to enroll.

By following these steps, you can identify and resolve the issue preventing macOS device enrollment in Intune. 
This process ensures that your device type restrictions are appropriately configured to support macOS devices.
