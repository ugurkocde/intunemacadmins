# Overview
After meeting the [Prerequisites](https://www.intunemacadmins.com/intune-getting-started-guide/prerequisites/) we turn over to the setup of the tenant and equipment of policies & apps.

<Steps>
1. Create groups & filters
2. Create compliance policy
3. Create configuration policies
4. Evaluate updating
5. Deploy apps
6. Create scripts (optional)
7. Create custom attributes (optional)
</Steps>

## Introduction
All management tasks can be done within Intune > Devices > macOS - here you can configure and monitor everything:

# 1. Groups & filters
First, let's create a group/filter where your Macs are automatically added to target policies and other contents.

**Entra dynamic group query**
```
(device.deviceOSType -eq "macMDM")
```

**Intune filter query**
```
(device.model -contains "Mac")
```

<Aside>
It is recommended to use Intune filters, since the processing is faster than groups.

# 2. Compliance policy
A compliance policy is the fundamental part of the Intune management, because it determines if the Mac is fullfilling basic requirements in order to access corporate resources. Let's start with a basic version of it:

# 3. Create configuraiton policies
Configuration is a wide area and offers a lot of options. You can configure nearly every aspect of the system to get your desired look & feel.
Some recommended policies are found [here](https://github.com/thenikk/Oceanleaf/tree/main/Intune%20-%20macOS)

<Aside>
It is recommended to use Settings Catalog whenever possible.

# 4. Evaluate updating
When it comes to OS updating, you have to main built-in options:
-   macOS updates policy in Intune (less control options)
-   Settings Catalog DDM update configuration (recommended)

# 5. Deploy apps
Intune supports app deployment to:
-   Deploy apps from different repositories/stores
-   Configure apps and monitor the status
-   Provide apps as available from Company Portal

There are different sources with different behaviors to get apps from:
-   Built-in in Intune: Microsoft 365 Apps, Edge, Defender for Endpoint
-   Web clip or link (just a shortcut to a URL)
-   Apple Volume Purchase Program (VPP), requires Apple Business Manager - apps are 'aquired' there and synced to Intune
-   macOS types:
    -   DMG = Disk Image, basically just an application file
    -   PKG = Package, more configuration options (insatller behavior)

# 6. Create scripts (optional)
macOS scripts are based on shell and can be deployed to managed endpoints. [Here](https://github.com/microsoft/shell-intune-samples/tree/master/macOS) you can find a repo with some inspiration.

# 7. Create custom attributes (optional)
Custom attributes are shell scripts that read out a system value in a string, integer or date. This is practical for custom inventory data or retrieving a status on the system.
