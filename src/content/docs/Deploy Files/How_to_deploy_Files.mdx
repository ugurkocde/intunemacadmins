Deploying files to Intune-managed macOS devices can be challenging. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a .pkg application to securely deploy your files on macOS devices.

## Why Use This Method?

There are several advantages to using a .pkg application for file deployment:

- No need to host files remotely or in the cloud
- No need for secrets in scripts
- Increased security compared to public endpoints or Azure Blob Storage

The main potential disadvantage is the initial setup time, which takes about 10 minutes, and the requirement of a macOS device for packaging.

## Creating the PKG Application

<Steps>
1. **Create the folder structure**
   - Organize your folders into two main directories: `Content` and `Scripts`
   - The `Content` folder will contain the files you want to deploy
   - The `Scripts` folder will contain the `postinstall` script
1. **Create the postinstall script**
   - Place the script in the `Scripts` folder
   - Make it executable with: `chmod a+x postinstall`
   - Remove any file extensions (e.g., .sh)
   - [View the full postinstall script example](https://github.com/ugurkocde/Intune/blob/main/MacOS/Create%20pkg%20/postinstall)
2. **Execute pkgbuild to create the .pkg file**
   - Run the following command in the terminal:
     ```
     pkgbuild --root Content --scripts Scripts --identifier com.yourdomain.yourapp --install-location /var/tmp --version 1.0 YourApp.pkg
     ```
   - Replace `com.yourdomain.yourapp` with your organization's identifier
   - Replace `YourApp.pkg` with the desired name for your .pkg file
3. **Upload the .pkg file to Intune**
   - Go to the Microsoft Intune portal
   - Navigate to **Apps** > **All apps** > **Add**
   - Select **Line-of-business app**
   - Upload your .pkg file
   - Configure the app settings as needed
   - Assign the app to your desired groups or users
4. **Deploy the app to your devices**
   - The app will be installed on the devices in the assigned groups or users
   - The files will be deployed to the specified location on the devices
</Steps>
