Intro
I always recommend the use of Apple Business Manager. Why you could say, well Apple Business Manager is a free service provided by Apple that allows organizations to manage three things: devices, apps, and accounts. Simply put, if your organization owns Apple devices, you should be using Apple Business Manager (or its education-sector equivalent, Apple School Manager). There’s literally no downside to it. Apple Business manager offers many benefits—some well-known, others less so—and it doesn’t cost a thing.

First to define what we’re talking about: Apple Business Manager is an all-in-one portal designed to help organizations deploy Apple devices, manage organization-owned Apple IDs, and acquire apps and other content in volume. It coordinates closely with mobile device management solutions to automatically enroll and manage devices. Apple Business Manager is not an MDM solution itself, this just to be clear.

To use Apple Business Manager, your organization must first have an account. Applying is simple, and although it can take a couple of days for your application to be approved, it typically happens much faster. It just requires some basic information, including your DUNS number and contact information for someone at your company—not an IT admin, more likely someone higher up—who can vouch for you. Apple will then verify everything and, if it all checks out, confirm your account. (More information on all this can be found in [Apple’s Getting Started guide](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/site/Apple_Business_Manager_Getting_Started_Guide.pdf).
