## Intro

I always recommend the use of Apple Business Manager. Why you could say, well Apple Business Manager is a free service provided by Apple that allows organizations to manage three things: devices, apps, and accounts. Simply put, if your organization owns Apple devices, you should be using Apple Business Manager (or its education-sector equivalent, Apple School Manager). Thereâ€™s literally no downside to it. Apple Business manager offers many benefitsâ€”some well-known, others less soâ€”and it doesnâ€™t cost a thing.

First to define what weâ€™re talking about: Apple Business Manager is an all-in-one portal designed to help organizations deploy Apple devices, manage organization-owned Apple IDs, and acquire apps and other content in volume. It coordinates closely with mobile device management solutions to automatically enroll and manage devices. Apple Business Manager is not an MDM solution itself, this just to be clear.

To use Apple Business Manager, your organization must first have an account. Applying is simple, and although it can take a couple of days for your application to be approved, it typically happens much faster. It just requires some basic information, including your DUNS number and contact information for someone at your companyâ€”not an IT admin, more likely someone higher upâ€”who can vouch for you. Apple will then verify everything and, if it all checks out, confirm your account. More information on all this can be found in [Appleâ€™s Getting Started guide](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/site/Apple_Business_Manager_Getting_Started_Guide.pdf).

Why use Apple Business Manager, well some configuration can only be applied for supervised devices, only devices from Apple Business Manager are supervised devices, check table below.

In the different Intune configuration profiles you will also notice that some settings only apply on supervised devices.

<Aside>
This can be a lenghty process because you need to request the number and also Apple needs to do some verification. If you are planning to use Apple Business Manager and you have a deadline for your project please start early for the admin stuff that you cannot control.

Now you have 59 days left to verify your business and you will now have to request your D-U-N-S Number, first do a look up [here](https://developer.apple.com/enroll/duns-lookup/#!/search). If your organization was not found you can submit your information to request the number. I got my number in 48hrs
