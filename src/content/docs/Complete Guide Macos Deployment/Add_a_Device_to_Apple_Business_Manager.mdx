## Add a device to Apple Business Manager

To add devices to Apple Business Manager you have some options. You Apple reseller can add them for you when you order a device. You can also add a device yourself by using the Apple Configurator app on your phone, i’m going to explain this method. If you want your reseller to add the devices you can read this article: [Manage device suppliers in Apple Business Manager – Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-manager/manage-device-suppliers-axmef1c47493/web)

You can add the following devices using Apple Configurator to Apple Business Manager, even if they weren’t purchased directly from Apple or from an Apple Authorized Reseller or cellular carrier:

- iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV devices using Apple Configurator for Mac.
- iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers (running macOS 12.0.1 or later) with Apple silicon or the Apple T2 Security Chip using Apple Configurator for iPhone.

After you’ve set up the device or devices, they behave like any other device already in Apple Business Manager, with mandatory supervision and mobile device management (MDM) enrollment. The device can then be shut down and stored until needed or sent to the user. If the device is given to a user, they have a 30-day provisional period to release the device from Apple Business Manager, supervision, and MDM. This 30-day provisional period begins after the device is successfully assigned to and enrolled in:

- A third-party MDM server linked to Apple Business Manager.



## Create the Enrollment Profile

From this screen, you have two options:

- Use the iPhone camera (with the Apple Configurator app open) to scan the image on the screen.

- Select “Pair Manually” on the iPhone and click “Pair Manually” on your Mac. You will be shown a 6-digit code and be prompted to enter it.

I will use the scan option, you will now see your device being added to Apple Business Manager. When it is finished you will be presented by this screen.
