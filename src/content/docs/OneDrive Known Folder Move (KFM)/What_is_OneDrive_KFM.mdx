OneDrive Known Folder Move (KFM) allows the redirection of common folders to OneDrive, ensuring they are automatically backed up and accessible from any device and browser. On macOS, KFM supports the redirection of the following folders:

    ~/Desktop
    ~/Documents

To activate KFM on macOS, multiple Intune profiles are required. The specific profiles and configuration steps are detailed on the next page: [Configure KFM](https://www.intunemacadmins.com/onedrive-known-folder-move-kfm/configure_kfm/)
