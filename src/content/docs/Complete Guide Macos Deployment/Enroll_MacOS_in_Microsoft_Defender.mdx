sidebar:
  order: 8
---


## Prerequisites

To successfully enroll your MacOS (or any other OS for that mater) you will need to setup all connections between Intune and Defender. You can read about it here. Of course you will need the correct licenses:

- Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2 (standalone or as part of other Microsoft 365 plans)
- Microsoft Defender for Business (for small and medium-sized businesses)


To onboard servers to the standalone versions of Defender for Endpoint, server licenses are required. You can choose from:

- Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Plan 2 (as part of the Defender for Cloud) offering
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Servers
- Microsoft Defender for Business servers (for small and medium-sized businesses only)


## Enable Microsoft Defender in Intune

Sign in to the Microsoft Intune admin center. Select Endpoint security – Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and toggle the Allow Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to enforce Endpoint Security Configurations box to On.

Now you have enabled the connection between Microsoft Defender and Intune. Now let’s continue to create the different configuration profiles needed.

## Create system configuration profiles
**The System Extensions Policy**

The next step is to create system configuration profiles that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint needs. In the Microsoft Intune admin center, open Devices – MacOS – Configuration profiles. We will need a lot of policies configured for this so make sure you have some spare time for this 😉

On the Policies tab, select Create > New Policy.

- Under Platform, select macOS.
- Under Profile type, select Templates.
- Under Template name, select Extensions, and then select Create.
- Name your policy e.g  MacOS – Defender Extensions
- On the Configuration settings tab, expand System Extensions and add the following entries in the Allowed system extensions section:

**Bundle identifier**

- com.microsoft.wdav.epsext
- com.microsoft.wdav.netext

**Team identifier**

- UBF8T346G9

![Defender](/src/assets/CompleteGuide/image-120.webp)

Select Next. On the Assignments tab, assign the profile to a group where the macOS devices and/or users are located, or select the Add all users and Add all devices options. Then select Next. Review the configuration profile. Select Create.

**The Network Filter Policy**

As part of the Endpoint Detection and Response capabilities, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS inspects socket traffic and reports this information to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. The following policy allows the network extension to perform this functionality.

First we need to download the [netfilter.mobileconfig file](https://intunestuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/netfilter.zip) – Unzip the file somewhere on your PC.

To configure network filter:

- Under Configuration profiles, select Create Profile.
- Under Platform, select macOS.
- Under Profile type, select Templates.
- Under Template name, select Custom.
- Select Create.
- On the Basics tab, Name the profile e.g. MacOS – Network Filter
- On the Configuration settings tab, enter a Custom configuration profile name e.g. Network Filter
- Deployment Channel: Device Channel (we are going to scope all Defender policies on device groups)
- Configuration profile file: Browse for the downloaded file

![Defender](/src/assets/CompleteGuide/image-122.webp)

Select Next. On the Assignments tab, assign the profile to a group where the macOS devices and/or users are located, or select the Add all users and Add all devices options. Then select Next. Review the configuration profile. Select Create.

## The Full Disk Access Policy

Starting with macOS Catalina (10.15) or newer, in order to provide privacy for the end-users, it created the FDA (Full Disk Access). Enabling TCC (Transparency, Consent & Control) through a Mobile Device Management solution such as Intune, will eliminate the risk of Defender for Endpoint losing Full Disk Access Authorization to function properly.

This configuration profile grants Full Disk Access to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. If you previously configured Microsoft Defender for Endpoint through Intune, we recommend you update the deployment with this configuration profile.

First we need to download the [Fulldisk.mobileconfig file](https://intunestuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FullDisk.zip) – Unzip the file somewhere on your PC.

## The Background Services Policy

macOS 13 (Ventura) contains new privacy enhancements. Beginning with this version, by default, applications cannot run in background without explicit consent. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint must run its daemon process in background. This configuration profile grants Background Service permissions to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. If you previously configured Microsoft Defender for Endpoint through Microsoft Intune, we recommend you update the deployment with this configuration profile.

First we need to download the [BackgroundServices.mobileconfig file](https://intunestuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BackgroundServices.zip) – Unzip the file somewhere on your PC.

Bluetooth granted through Apple MDM Configuration Profile is not reflected in System Settings => Privacy & Security => Bluetooth.
