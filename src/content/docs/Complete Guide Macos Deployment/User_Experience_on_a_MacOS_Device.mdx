## User Experience on a MacOS Device

Remember that we left our Mac device after we enrolled it in Apple Business Manager, reboot it. Now just follow the setup assistant to continue onboarding you Mac into Intune With Platform SSO. These are the screenshots during enrollment. Apparently there is a limit on the screenshots you can make during the setup assistant so i missed some. But i think you will get the  complete overview of what is going on. My apologies for this.
